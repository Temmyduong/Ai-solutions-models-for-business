# Ai-solutions-models-for-business

## Project Overview
This repository contains three advanced AI projects completed for the MIS780 – Advanced Artificial Intelligence for Business unit at Deakin University. Each task focuses on solving a real-world business problem using modern machine learning or deep learning techniques in Python.

### Task 1: House Price Prediction (Tabular Data)
Objective:
Predict house prices using various features such as size, location, and number of rooms.
Methods:
Linear Regression
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with different architectures
Outcome:
Identified the most effective model for real-world deployment based on performance metrics like RMSE and R² score.

### Task 2: Waste Classification (Image Data)
Objective:
Classify waste images into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and vegetation.
Methods:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Architecture tuning: different kernel sizes, hidden layers, and nodes
Outcome:
Achieved high classification accuracy. Identified the weakest performing class and proposed solutions to improve it through better data and model adjustments.

### Task 3: Gold Price Forecasting (Time Series)
Objective:
Forecast daily gold prices in USD for 14 days ahead using multivariate time-series data from 1985 to 2023.
Methods:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Sequence modelling with various time window settings
Outcome:
Developed and evaluated models to identify the optimal architecture for forecasting, suitable for business strategy and investment planning.
